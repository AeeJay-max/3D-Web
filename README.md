# 3D Web Experiment

This is a personal 3D web experiment built as part of my learning journey as a Software Engineering student at HIT. The project is purely frontend-focused and serves as a visual showcase for experimenting with interactive 3D elements on the web.

## Live Demo

## About the Project

- The Spline 3D object used in this project was sourced from a YouTube video description.
- The focus of the project was on frontend integration, pointer-based interactions, and modern UI design.
- There is no backend or functional application logic — the project exists purely for experimentation and learning purposes.
- This project sparked my interest in 3D web development, and I am now actively learning Spline to create and customize my own 3D objects in future projects.

## Features

- Interactive 3D object that follows the pointer on the webpage
- Modern UI design with gradient and shadow effects
- Fully frontend implementation using React (or specify framework if different)

## Motivation

The goal of this project was to explore and learn:
- How to integrate 3D assets into web applications
- Interactive pointer-based 3D effects
- Frontend UI experimentation and hands-on practice

## Future Plans

- Learn Spline to create custom 3D objects
- Add more interactive elements and animations
- Experiment with combining multiple 3D objects in a single scene
